## Setting up the blog
I set up the jekyll blog with githup pages and used the dinky theme. It's pretty ugly but i have 0 experience with css and barely any with building html and I would like to sleep so thats for another day, at least it exists. The home page could do with improvements given the list is very confusing and I need to ass dome navigation tabs, probaby to the base layout, but for now, goodnight:)
